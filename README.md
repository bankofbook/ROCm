Thanks Rigtop providing intial build steps <https://gist.github.com/rigtorp/d9483af100fb77cee57e4c9fa3c74245> , which contains build steps for HIP on rocm-3.6.

Thanks jlgreathouse providing <https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/Experimental_ROC> , which contains build steps for rocm-2.10 .

My environment is Ubuntu-20.04.1.

Please download sources using repo <https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html#getting-the-rocm-source-code> ,
and change the path of source in 3.8.0/env.sh .

Execute `bash env.sh` to setup environment variables, then execute bash scripts by order number.

Good luck.
